My first conclusion is the amount of per student budget don't have any correlation withe the overall passing. 
The lower per student budget they had a higher overall passing rate which is very impressive. 
Actually, the lower the Per Student Budget the better outcome they had, it shows the students were more hungry to learn, and grow in their education.


My second conclusion is the amount of students size of each school, which makes sense small, and medium have a higher overall passing
means the smaller room, teacher have higher attention, which reflects the attention every student need, and it's not effective to have lots of student in one room. 
it could be a got stat for teachers to prove they are very neccesary for students. Including to this, charters school have more money and less students
which they are able to mantain teachers and also have reduce amount students per room. We could notice this by Highest Performing Schools by OVerall 

According to the analysis I see that the average reading scores, and average math scores mantains through out all the grades starting from 9th to 12th
